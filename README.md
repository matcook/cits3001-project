# CITS3001 Project

Completed by Mathew Cook (23222623) and Simon Eason (23389488).

## Setup

A ``requirements.txt`` file is provided with the necessary dependencies to install. This project was developed with ``virtualenv`` and ``pip``. 

If a virtual environment is desired, run the following commands:

```
virtualenv venv
[ACTIVATE VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT. STEPS WILL DIFFER BASED ON OS]
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If no virtual environment is desired, then only one command needs to be run:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

```
python rulebased.py
```

Two windows will appear, one of them the actual game being played by the agent, and the other the debug window showing what the agent sees via optical template recognition.

This agent relies on specific values set during the development process, and as such can only complete the first level.



## Agent 2 -
